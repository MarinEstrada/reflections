Learned some new things, basically had more practice with things learned in lesson one to be honest.
Don't forget, if you want to know what caused a bug to be introduced take a look at the file before and the one that introduced the bug using "git diff"
Also, if you don't know where the bug was introduced yet, use the comments of each commit as a hint! For example if you know that the bug has something to do with say... clones in a game (see the game pappy-pakia), look for a comment that mentions some sort of change to the clones!
