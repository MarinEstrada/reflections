to rebase use command:
	'git rebase -i NEWBASE~#'
		-i = interactive, change the history of commits or combine several into 1
		NEWBASE = The new base, if newbase is the same branch use 'HEAD'
		~# = how many commits you'd like to edit, only use in conjunction with -i 


Want to move branches without committing, and without losing work?
use command
        "git stash"
will save in a stack! To require stashed stuff, use 
        "git stash pop"
NOTE: this command wil return the whole stack. to only retrieve N items, need to learn functionality
