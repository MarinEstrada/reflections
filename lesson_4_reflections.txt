LESSON 4: Using github
learning how to transfter files from local repository onto github
STEPS:
1 create an empty repository on github this is going to be a remote repository, which is more comonly known as "remotes"
	you can push and pull data from remots, what you send and receive are in the form of commits.

	BUT instead of sending individual commits, the most common way to push and pull data is by pushing/pulling a branch, thus getting all the commits associated with that branch
		Note: if a commit already exists in one of the repositories it will not resend that commit, only all the new commits not yet associated with the branch.
		it would be innificient to resend each commit over and over each time

create empty repository on github (using the plus sign) 
	if you were to be creating an empty repository an would have no commits to put in, then initialize with readme. Otherwise not needed

On you command line, use 
'git remote' 
to see what remotes (remote repositories) exist

to add a repo, use the following command:
'git remote add REMOTE_NAME URL'
remote name -> if you only have one remote for that repository its standard to name it 'origin', 
the url will be available via github. copy and paste

afterwards, to verify that the url was added correctly... use the following command:
'git remote -v'
-v = verbose

from local to remote!
use command 
'git push -u REMOTE_NAME BRANCH_NAME'
-u = sets the branch you are curently pushing as upstream, this is good for branches such as the master branch

note you can also add commits to remote directly on github!

to pull from remote onto local repo, use the same format but with the pull command
i.e.:
'git pull REMOTE_NAME BRANCH NAME'
if you just want to pull from the pustream, 'git pull' is enough

REFLECTIONS:
When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	This would be ideal when you don't have access to your personal computer

REFLECTIONS: Remote vs Manual pull
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	in cases where you are working in a group, if a group member adds something and it automatically gets pulled into your local repo, then your work might get lost if you were working on a different version of the same new commit. its better to just manually pull when you think its a good idea.
